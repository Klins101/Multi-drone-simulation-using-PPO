# Multi-drone-simulation-using-Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains an implementation for training a multi-drone system to coordinate actions in order to hover. It was developed using the Gym Bullet Drones environment, which is built on OpenAI's Gym framework, PyBullet, Stable Baselines, and RLlib-Ray packages.
